Reflecting on my work with the Contact and ContactService classes, I have learned that writing clear and understandable code is important for both functionality and security. By organizing my code well and using simple language, I make it easier for others to follow and maintain. Regular testing helps me catch mistakes early and keeping my software updated protects it from known security issues. Also, reviewing my code with others can help find and fix problems I might have missed. Understanding user needs is important to creating useful software. I would do this by talking to others and getting their feedback, which would allow me to design features that meet their expectations. Creating simple versions of my software would allow users to interact with it and provide feedback which would help me make improvements. This approach makes sure that the software I develop is both functional and secure.
